Server Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique that allows you to render the content of a page on the server side, before it is sent to the user's browser. With SSR, the server sends a ready-made page to the browser, with all its HTML, CSS and JavaScript content.

In Next.js, SSR is one of the core features. When a page is first loaded, Next.js renders the content server-side and sends the resulting HTML to the user's browser. After that, Next.js sends only the necessary updates to the browser, using React to incrementally update the page.

This has several advantages, including improved SEO, reduced page load times, and a better user experience, especially on slower internet connections.

In summary, SSR in Next.js allows you to create pages with dynamic, interactive and responsive content while still maintaining fast loading speed and good user experience.
